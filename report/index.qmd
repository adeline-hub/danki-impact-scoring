## Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

IDRIS is an **impact-first due diligence scoring framework** designed for investment
professionals, ESG compliance officers, external investors and regulators evaluating
projects from €1,500 micro-investments to €50,000,000 infrastructure and private equity
transactions across all geographies.

Unlike conventional ESG rating systems — which measure corporate sustainability
*disclosures* — IDRIS measures the **real-world outcomes** of an investment activity
against today's critical global challenges: climate change, gender inequality, social
mobility, territorial wealth distribution, pollution, corruption and democratic governance.

The framework operates on two layers:

- **Regulatory compliance gate** — verifies adherence to the five applicable EU
  frameworks (EU Taxonomy, SFDR, CSRD/ESRS, TCFD, PRIIPs/MiFID II)
- **Extended impact composite score** — measures transformative outcomes across
  eight dimensions, weighted to reflect the empirically-established hierarchy of
  social determinants

The central methodological departure from ESG is the **Social Priority Principle**:
gender equity, social mobility and governance together account for **50% of the total
score**, on the basis that social determinants are upstream of all other outcomes. A
project delivering strong climate metrics but failing on gender equity or local value
creation is extractive, not transformative. IDRIS will not classify it as green.

This whitepaper is addressed to four audiences: **investment analysts** who use the
scoring app daily; **ESG and compliance officers** who need to map outputs to regulatory
obligations; **external investors and LPs** who need to understand methodology
robustness; and **regulators** (AMF, ECB, EBA) who need to verify that the framework
meets or exceeds current EU requirements.

## The Problem with ESG

### ESG Measures Disclosure, Not Outcome

The widespread adoption of ESG frameworks since 2015 has produced a paradox: the
volume of sustainability disclosure has increased dramatically while the measurable
real-world outcomes on climate, inequality and biodiversity have continued to deteriorate.
The reason is structural. ESG frameworks — including those mandated by SFDR and CSRD —
measure whether a company *reports on* environmental and social risks, not whether its
activities *produce positive outcomes* for people and ecosystems.

A coal company with excellent sustainability reporting will score well on SFDR PAI
disclosure. A microfinance institution in rural Senegal with no compliance department will
score poorly. The signal is inverted relative to impact.

### The Green and Social Washing Problem

IDRIS is designed explicitly to resist greenwashing and social washing — the practices by
which investment products present themselves as sustainable or impactful without
substantive evidence of real-world benefit. The three design choices that operationalise
this resistance are:

**Outcome orientation.** Every dimension score is derived from observable project
characteristics — sector, geography, investment size, GHG intensity — not from
self-reported ESG disclosures, which are subject to selection bias, measurement
inconsistency and regulatory arbitrage.

**Social Priority Principle.** By weighting gender equity and social mobility at 35% of
the total composite, IDRIS ensures that no project can reach a Green or Dark Green band
through environmental performance alone. Climate action that does not benefit women,
workers and local communities is not transformative impact.

**Social Veto Rule.** If a project scores below 30 out of 100 on either the gender equity
or social mobility dimension, it is automatically capped at Amber regardless of its
composite score. This is not a penalty — it is a recognition that certain social failures
are disqualifying, not merely penalising.

---

## The IDRIS Framework

### Design Principles

IDRIS was designed around five principles drawn from the impact investment literature
(IMP, GIIN, Bridgespan Group, UNDP SDG Finance):

1. **Additionality.** The framework rewards investments that go beyond what would have
   happened anyway — projects in underserved geographies, underfinanced sectors, or
   with explicit inclusion mandates score higher than equivalent projects in
   well-served markets.

2. **Materiality.** Scores are weighted toward dimensions where the investment has
   measurable causal influence — a microfinance project has high gender and social
   materiality; a renewable energy plant has high climate and pollution materiality.

3. **Contextualisation.** Country-level data (Transparency International CPI, ND-GAIN
   Climate Vulnerability Index, UNDP Human Development Index) adjusts scores for
   operating context. A 5 MW solar plant in Nigeria represents greater additionality
   than the same plant in Denmark.

4. **Explainability.** Every component of every dimension score is a simple algebraic
   function of observable inputs. There are no black-box transformations, no
   embeddings, no latent variables. Any analyst or regulator can reproduce any score
   from first principles using the formulas in @sec-formulas.

5. **Regulatory coherence.** The framework is designed to be a *superset* of
   regulatory requirements — every SFDR PAI indicator is represented, every EU Taxonomy
   objective is addressable, every TCFD category is covered. Passing the regulatory gate
   is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a high IDRIS score.

## Dimension Scoring Methodology {#sec-formulas}

### Weight Rationale: The Social Priority Principle

The weight allocation reflects a specific theoretical position: **social determinants are
upstream of environmental outcomes**. This position is grounded in the following evidence:

The World Bank's 2023 Gender Strategy demonstrates that gender equality is the single
strongest predictor of long-term development outcomes, outperforming GDP per capita, rule
of law and institutional quality as a predictor of sustainable economic growth. UNDP's
Human Development Index data across 191 countries shows that HDI improvement is
three times faster in countries with high gender equality scores.

Social mobility — the ability of individuals and communities to improve their economic
position through access to education, employment and services — determines whether
economic value generated by an investment *stays* in the territory or is extracted by
distant capital holders. An investment that generates €10M in revenue but captures none
of it locally has negative territorial impact regardless of its sectoral characteristics.

Governance and anti-corruption functions as a **multiplier**: in high-corruption
environments, all other positive impacts are diminished through rent extraction,
misallocation and institutional decay. The empirical relationship between Transparency
International CPI scores and development outcomes is among the most robust findings in
development economics.

### Gender & Social Equity (20%)

**What it measures:** The degree to which the investment promotes gender equality and
reduces structural discrimination — in the workplace, the supply chain, and the
communities served.

**Formula:**

$$G = \left( g \cdot 55 + \frac{\text{CPI}}{100} \cdot 25 + \text{HDI} \cdot 15 - \left(1 - \frac{\text{CPI}}{100}\right) \cdot 20 \right) \times \frac{100}{75}$$

Where $g$ is the gender equality factor (0–1, derived from sector and analyst override),
CPI is the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index (0–100) for the country
of operation, and HDI is the UNDP Human Development Index (0–1).

The term $-(1-\text{CPI}/100)\times 20$ is the **corruption-gender penalty**: high
corruption actively suppresses women's economic participation through enforcement
failures, institutional bias and informal economy dominance. This term gives the formula
its full 0–100 range — a project in a high-corruption, low-development country with a
gender-insensitive sector will score in the 15–30 range, triggering the Social Veto Rule.

**Social Veto Rule:** If Gender score < 30, the project band is capped at Amber.

### Social Mobility (15%)

**What it measures:** The degree to which the investment creates durable economic
opportunity for local communities — employment quality, skills transfer, living wage
access, and the share of economic value retained in the territory.

**Formula:**

$$S = s_f \cdot 50 + \text{HDI} \cdot 25 + \sigma \cdot 15 + b - (1 - \text{HDI})(1 - s_f) \cdot 25$$

Where $s_f$ is the sector social factor (0.82 for high-social sectors, 0.38 for
extractive, 0.60 otherwise), $\sigma$ is the investment size factor (log-normalised
0–1), and $b$ is a sector bonus (+15 for Healthcare, Education, Microfinance, Financial
Inclusion, Social Infrastructure, Affordable Housing, Water & Sanitation).

The structural deprivation penalty term $(1 - \text{HDI})(1 - s_f) \cdot 25$ ensures
that an extractive industry project in a low-development country cannot achieve a high
social mobility score — even at large scale. It is specifically designed to prevent
large-ticket infrastructure projects in low-HDI countries from scoring well through scale
alone without genuine local value creation.

**Social Veto Rule:** If Social score < 30, the project band is capped at Amber.

### Governance & Anti-Corruption (15%)

**What it measures:** The institutional quality of the operating environment, the
transparency of ownership structures, and the exposure to corruption, money laundering
and regulatory arbitrage.

**Formula:**

$$\Gamma = \frac{\text{CPI}}{100} \cdot 65 + \delta_{\text{EU}} \cdot 20 + \delta_{\text{asset}} \cdot 10$$

Where $\delta_{\text{EU}}$ is 1 if the project is in an EU member state (EU regulatory
perimeter provides enhanced investor protection, AML enforcement and beneficial ownership
transparency), and $\delta_{\text{asset}}$ is 1 if the asset class is Green Bond or
Project Finance (both require structured governance frameworks).

This dimension maps directly to SFDR PAI indicators 16 (exposure to controversial
weapons) and 17 (tax jurisdiction), and to CSDDD Article 3 due diligence requirements on
governance of value chain partners.

### Climate & Environment (18%)

**Formula:**

$$C = (1 - \gamma) \cdot 70 + \delta_{\text{tax}} \cdot 20 - V \cdot 15 + \sigma \cdot 5$$

Where $\gamma$ is GHG intensity (0–1, sector default or analyst override), $\delta_{\text{tax}}$
is 1 if the sector is EU Taxonomy-eligible, $V$ is the ND-GAIN climate vulnerability
score (0–1) for the country of operation, and $\sigma$ is the size factor.

The vulnerability deduction reflects physical climate risk: a project operating in a
highly climate-vulnerable territory faces greater risk of stranded assets and reduced
long-term climate contribution. This term links directly to TCFD physical risk assessment.

### Pollution & Health (10%)

**Formula:**

$$P = (1 - \gamma) \cdot 75 + \delta_{\text{tax}} \cdot 20$$

A simplified function of GHG intensity and taxonomy eligibility. Projects with low
emissions intensity and in taxonomy-eligible sectors (which must pass DNSH on pollution
prevention) receive the highest scores. Maps to EU Taxonomy Objective 3 (prevention and
control of pollution).

### Water & Resources (8%)

**Formula:**

$$W = 70 - \Delta_{\text{water}} - V \cdot 20$$

Where $\Delta_{\text{water}}$ is 40 if GHG intensity > 0.4 (water-intensive sectors
such as extractive industry and heavy manufacturing), otherwise $\gamma \times 30$.
Maps to EU Taxonomy Objective 4 and SFDR PAI 6 (water usage and recycling).

### Territory & Local Wealth (8%)

**Formula:**

$$T = 30 + (1 - \text{HDI}) \cdot 40 + \delta_{\text{EU}} \cdot 20 + \sigma \cdot 10$$

The $(1 - \text{HDI}) \cdot 40$ term encodes a key principle: **investments in
lower-development territories have greater additionality potential**. A €500,000
microfinance project in rural Ethiopia has greater territorial development impact than the
same amount invested in a French urban SME, even if the French project is better
governed. This does not reward poor governance — the governance dimension handles that
separately. It rewards geographic additionality.

### Innovation & Resilience (6%)

**Formula:**

$$I = 40 + \delta_{\text{innov}} \cdot 30 + \sigma \cdot 20 + \text{HDI} \cdot 10$$

Where $\delta_{\text{innov}}$ is 1 for sectors classified as innovation-intensive:
Renewable Energy, Digital Infrastructure, Clean Transportation, Energy Efficiency,
Circular Economy, Education & Skills, Financial Inclusion, Water & Sanitation.

## The Social Veto Rule

The Social Veto Rule is the most distinctive feature of the IDRIS framework and the one
most likely to be challenged by issuers seeking high ratings. We address the challenge directly.

**The rule:** If the Gender equity dimension score falls below 30/100 OR the Social
mobility dimension score falls below 30/100, the project band is capped at **Amber**,
regardless of the composite IDRIS score. The composite score itself is not altered — it
still appears in the output — but the regulatory band and SFDR article
recommendation are downgraded.

**Why 30 and not a higher threshold?** The threshold of 30 is calibrated to represent a
*structural* failure rather than a *contextual weakness*. A score of 30 on the gender
dimension corresponds approximately to an extractive sector project operating in a high-
corruption, very-low-development country with no gender policy provisions. This is not
a borderline case — it represents a combination of sector, geography and governance
that is systematically hostile to gender equality. The threshold is not designed to
penalise well-intentioned projects in difficult contexts; it is designed to identify
projects where gender equity failure is load-bearing to the business model.

**Regulatory basis:** While no current EU regulation mandates a social veto rule in
these precise terms, the rule is consistent with:

- SFDR Article 4 mandatory PAI disclosure requirements (PAI 12: gender pay gap,
  PAI 13: board gender diversity)
- CSDDD Articles 3–7 on human rights and working conditions due diligence
- The European Parliament's 2023 position on the Social Taxonomy, which proposed
  minimum social safeguards as preconditions for taxonomy alignment
- IFC Performance Standard 2 on Labor and Working Conditions
- The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises

## Regulatory Framework Mapping

### EU Taxonomy

The IDRIS framework maps to all six EU Taxonomy environmental objectives:

| Obj. | Description | IDRIS dimensions |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Climate change mitigation | Climate (18%), Pollution (10%) |
| 2 | Climate change adaptation | Climate (18%), Territory (8%) |
| 3 | Sustainable use of water | Water (8%) |
| 4 | Circular economy | Water (8%), Innovation (6%) |
| 5 | Pollution prevention | Pollution (10%) |
| 6 | Biodiversity | Climate (18%), Water (8%) |

Taxonomy eligibility is assessed by sector classification. Taxonomy alignment requires
passing the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) test (GHG intensity < 0.50 AND climate
vulnerability < 0.70) and achieving a Substantial Contribution score > 40%.

### SFDR Principal Adverse Impact Indicators

All 18 mandatory PAI indicators are represented in the IDRIS aggregate PAI score:

| PAI | Description | IDRIS mapping |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | GHG emissions intensity | Climate, Pollution dimensions |
| 2 | Carbon footprint | Climate dimension |
| 3 | GHG intensity of investee companies | Climate dimension |
| 4 | Exposure to fossil fuel sector | Sector classification |
| 5 | Non-renewable energy consumption | Climate, Innovation |
| 6 | Energy consumption intensity | Water dimension |
| 7 | Biodiversity-sensitive areas | Climate dimension |
| 8 | Water emissions | Water dimension |
| 9 | Hazardous waste | Pollution dimension |
| 10 | Violations of UNGC / OECD | Governance dimension |
| 11 | Lack of UNGC / OECD process | Governance dimension |
| 12 | Unadjusted gender pay gap | Gender dimension |
| 13 | Board gender diversity | Gender dimension |
| 14 | Exposure to controversial weapons | Governance dimension |
| 15 | GHG intensity (real estate) | Climate dimension |
| 16 | Energy performance (real estate) | Climate dimension |
| 17 | Exposure to fossil fuels (real estate) | Climate dimension |
| 18 | Exposure to energy-inefficient assets | Climate dimension |

### SFDR Article Classification Logic

```{=html}
<div class="sfdr-logic-box">
  <div class="sfdr-article sfdr-9">
    <div class="sfdr-art-label">Article 9</div>
    <div class="sfdr-art-conditions">
      EU Taxonomy aligned <strong>AND</strong> IDRIS ≥ 72 <strong>AND</strong> PAI score ≥ 70
    </div>
    <div class="sfdr-art-desc">Sustainable investment objective. Highest disclosure burden.

    </div>
    <div class="sfdr-art-desc">Promotes environmental or social characteristics. Must disclose
    PAI consideration methodology and binding E/S elements in investment strategy.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="sfdr-article sfdr-6">
    <div class="sfdr-art-label">Article 6</div>
    <div class="sfdr-art-conditions">All other cases</div>
    <div class="sfdr-art-desc">No specific sustainability claims. Sustainability risk
    integration disclosure required.</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### TCFD Climate Risk Assessment

IDRIS generates two TCFD risk flags per project:

**Physical risk** is derived from the ND-GAIN Climate Vulnerability Index for the country
of operation. Low: vulnerability < 0.40. Medium: 0.40–0.65. High: > 0.65.

**Transition risk** is derived from sector classification. High-transition sectors
(Extractive Industry, Manufacturing, Food & Nutrition, Private Equity diversified) face
significant regulatory and market disruption risk under 1.5°C–2°C pathways. Low-
transition sectors (Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, Clean Transportation, Circular
Economy, Biodiversity) are net beneficiaries of the transition.

### CSRD / ESRS Double Materiality

Following the 2025 Omnibus revision, CSRD applies to companies with > 1,000 employees
and > €450M turnover. IDRIS applies a proxy rule: projects with investment > €5M in
EU jurisdictions outside financial inclusion sectors are flagged as likely in-scope for
CSRD reporting by the investee company.

Double materiality flags are generated for impact materiality (does the activity have
significant environmental or social impacts?) and financial materiality (are
sustainability risks material to the financial performance of the investment?).

### PRIIPs / MiFID II Suitability

IDRIS generates a MiFID II suitability score (0–10) for each project, combining the
IDRIS composite score, SFDR article classification and TCFD risk flags. This feeds
directly into investor preference matching under MiFID II Article 9(1)(a) sustainability
preference assessment, enabling portfolio-level suitability reporting.

## Country and Sector Reference Data

### Country Context Indices

Country calibration data is sourced from three publicly available, annually-updated indices:

- **Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)** — used in governance
  and gender dimension scoring. Scores range 0–100 (0=highly corrupt, 100=very clean).
  2023 data.
- **Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) Climate Vulnerability Index** —
  used in climate and water dimension scoring and TCFD physical risk classification.
  Scores range 0–1 (0=low vulnerability, 1=high vulnerability). 2022 data.
- **UNDP Human Development Index (HDI)** — used in social mobility, gender, territory
  and innovation dimension scoring. Scores range 0–1 (0=low development, 1=very high
  development). 2023 data.

The framework covers 50 countries spanning all major investment geographies. For unlisted
countries, a conservative default (CPI=45, Vuln=0.50, HDI=0.70) is applied.

## Validation and Benchmarking

### Synthetic Dataset

The IDRIS framework was developed and validated against a synthetic benchmark dataset of
2,000 investment projects generated using the `generate_data.py` module. The dataset
covers all 50 countries, all 20 sectors, all 6 asset classes, and a log-uniform
distribution of investment sizes from €1,500 to €50,000,000.

**Dataset statistics (2,000 projects):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| IDRIS score range | 23.3 – 84.0 |
| Mean IDRIS score | 58.5 |
| Article 9 classification | 9.7% |
| Article 8 classification | 70.4% |
| Article 6 classification | 19.9% |
| Taxonomy aligned | 40.1% |
| Social veto triggered | 1.1% |
| Dark Green band | 5.4% |
| Green band | 50.2% |
| Amber band | 37.6% |
| Red band | 6.9% |

### Score Coherence Checks

Three properties of the scoring system were validated against prior expectations:

**Geographic ordering.** Nordic EU member states (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) consistently
score highest; sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia score lowest on average. This reflects
the CPI, HDI and climate vulnerability differentials across regions. The scoring
correctly does *not* penalise low-HDI countries for having lower development scores — the
territory dimension includes an additionality term that rewards investment in
underserved geographies.

**Sector ordering.** Renewable Energy, Education and Microfinance score highest; Extractive
Industry and conventional Manufacturing score lowest. The ordering is consistent across
geographies — a renewable energy project in Nigeria scores higher than an extractive
project in Denmark.

**Social veto coherence.** The 22 veto-triggered projects in the dataset are exclusively
in high-corruption, low-development geographies with extractive or low-social-factor
sectors. No EU-member-state project triggers the veto. No social-sector project
(healthcare, education, microfinance) triggers the veto in any geography.

## Limitations and Future Development

### Current Limitations

**Sector granularity.** The current implementation uses 20 sector categories. Real-world
projects often span multiple sectors or represent niche activities not well-captured by
the taxonomy. Future versions will support multi-sector blending with user-defined
sector weights.

**Analyst data dependency.** The framework produces strongest results when analysts
provide project-specific data (actual GHG intensity, measured gender pay gap,
governance audit results). In the absence of such data, sector and country defaults are
applied — these are calibrated to be conservative but cannot substitute for field
due diligence.

**Dynamic index updates.** CPI, HDI and ND-GAIN data are updated annually. The framework
requires an annual recalibration of country reference data to remain current.

**Social veto threshold calibration.** The 30/100 threshold for the Social Veto Rule was
set by expert judgment and validated against the synthetic dataset. A formal empirical
calibration against real investment outcomes data would strengthen its defensibility
before regulators.

### Roadmap

- **v1.1:** Multi-sector blending, SFDR annex template auto-generation
- **v1.2:** Integration with Bloomberg ESG, MSCI ESG and Sustainalytics data APIs
- **v1.3:** Portfolio-level aggregation and fund-level SFDR entity reporting
- **v2.0:** Machine learning calibration layer trained on verified impact outcomes data
  from GIIN, IFC and development finance institutions
